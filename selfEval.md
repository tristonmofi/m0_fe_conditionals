# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
 - I feel confident in my understanding of comparison operators. 4 out of 5
2. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
 - I feel confident in my understanding of comparison operators. 4 out of 5
3. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
 - I feel confident in my understanding of comparison operators now. 4 out of 5. I did struggle with ```var numQuarters``` making sure both conditions could be achieved. It took me a minute to format the ```var cupsOfFlour && var hasSauce``` correctly. Turns out I was missing two == in the `if` statement. 
4. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate? 
 - I spent a little over two hours, as expected.
5. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
 - I need to practice my `if` `else if` and `else` statements. I will use Replit to practice this.
6. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
 - I believe most of my questions are answered, as I am sure there will be some critique from instructors that I will learn from. When I felt stumped on the formatting, I was able to technically search for answers while doing this assignment.
